(TN) State Assembly Elections -  (15th state assembly elections held May 2016) - 243 TALUKS
===========================================================================================
It has a strength of 235 members of whom 234 are democratically elected using the First-past-the-post system. The remaining member is nominated as a representative of the Anglo Indian community.
People directly elect their representatives for the Legislative assembly. Total strength of each assembly depends on each State, mostly based on size and population .
Eg: Tamil Nadu has 234 MLAs

Similar to Lok sabha elections, leader of the majority party/alliance takes oath as Chief Minister

Local Body Elections (Urban and Rural)
======================================
In Rural Local Bodies a voter has to cast 4 votes and in Urban Local Bodies a voter has to cast two votes.

In this case as well, people directly elect their representatives for a smaller geographical area. There are different types of local bodies. Corporations, Municipalities, Panchayats, etc.

Eg: In Tamil Nadu Chennai, Coimbatore, Trichy, etc are corporations and they elect a Mayor and also Ward Councillors. A ward is typically a very small geographical area. Unlike State and Central elections, people directly elect the Mayor. In most cases the party which has majority Councillors will also hold the mayor post because of popular support. People generally vote based on parties , not on any individuals.

Local bodies are categorized into two Urban Local Body and Rural Local Body. 

Urban Local Bodies
------------------
The urban local bodies acts as platform between the people in the urban areas and the administration.

    City Municipal Corporations
    Municipalities
    Town Panchayat

Larger cities of Tamil Nadu are governed by City Municipal Corporations (Tamil: மாநகராட்சிகள்). Tamil Nadu has 12 municipal corporations: Chennai, Coimbatore, Madurai, Tiruchirappalli, Tiruppur, Salem, Erode, Tirunelveli, Vellore, Thoothukudi, Dindigul and Thanjavur. These cities alone house one-third of urban population of the state. Corporation consists of a council of elected councilors from each ward and a presiding officer, Mayor who is also an elected representative.

Municipalities (Tamil: நகராட்சிகள்) fall next to the city corporations. There are about 123 Municipalities in Tamil Nadu. Municipalities have four categories based on their annual income and population. These include 15 special grade municipalities, 31 selection grade municipalities, 33 grade I municipalities, 44 grade II municipalities. Their elected representatives include ward councillors and a presiding officer, Municipal Chairperson. Municipal Commissioner is the executive authority.

Town panchayat (Tamil: பேரூராட்சிகள்) is the body of government for areas in transition form ‘rural’ to ‘urban’. Tamil Nadu is the first state to introduce such a classification in urban local bodies. The state has 529 town panchayats. Town panchayats are upgraded to Grade III municipalities if they are found to be eligible. They are categorized in a similar way to that of Municipalities depending on the income criteria and population. Town panchayat council include elected ward councilors and their presiding officer, Town panchayat chairperson. Executive Officer is the executive authority as in case of Town panchayats.

Rural Local Bodies
------------------
Rural local bodies include the panchayat raj institutions of this state. There are three levels in this system as follows.

    Village Panchayats
    Panchayat Unions(co-terminus with Blocks)
    District Panchayats in this state.

Village panchayats (Tamil: ஊராட்சிகள்) form the grass-root level of democracy as they form the local government for the basic building blocks of our country - villages. It is set up in villages where the population is less than 300. There are about 12,524 Village panchayats in this state. Gram Sabha is a part of Village panchayat which consists of elected ward members and Village panchayat president. Village panchayat president himself is an executive authority here. They must meet for minimum of four times a year.

Panchayat Union (Tamil: ஊராட்சி ஒன்றியம்) is the group of Village panchayats. They serve as the link between the villages and the district administration. They form the local government at the Taluk level. Tamil Nadu has 385 panchayat unions. Panchayat union council consists of elected ward members from the villages. It is headed by a panchayat union chairperson, who is elected indirectly by the ward members of the council.

District panchayats (Tamil: மாவட்ட ஊராட்சி ஒன்றியங்கள்) form the cream of the panchayat raj system. They take the top slot with mainly advisory powers to the rest. Developmental administration of the district in rural areas are in its hands. It consists of ward members elected from various villages in its jurisdiction. It is presided by district panchayat chairperson, who is indirectly elected by its ward members. There are 31 district panchayats in this state except for the district of Chennai as it is an urban district. District collector is the ex-officio chairman of the District rural development agency.
